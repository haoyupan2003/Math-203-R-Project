#You can embed an R code chunk like this:
2+4/3
(2+4)/3
# Anything after a # in a chunk is regarded as a comment.
# You can execute a chunk by clicking on the green triangle at the upper right-hand corner of this chunk.
2+4/3

# We can create basic data sets like this:
x = sample(1:50,size = 20, replace = TRUE)
x
x = sample(1:50,size = 20, replace = TRUE)
x
w = sample(1:100,size = 30, replace = TRUE)

w = sample(1:100,size = 30, replace = TRUE)

# We can compute basic statistics and visualize data sets.
