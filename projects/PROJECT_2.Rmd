In this second project we will use the package "ggplot". The name ""ggplot" comes from the so-called "Grammar of Graphs." 
Under this grammar, a plot consists of the following layers:

1. data, 
2. aesthetics, 
3. geometries, 
4. facets, 
5. statistics, 
6. coordinates, and 
7. themes. 



```{r}
# We load libraries

library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

# You may have to install "mosaic". If so, open the console excute the instruction:  install.packages("mosaic")

library(mosaic)

# As usual, we also opening the NHANES set.

library(NHANES)
View(NHANES)   

# If you have a Mac, put a # symbol in from of the 'View' command.

```


The typical command to create a plot with ggplot goes like this:

ggplot( data  , aes( x= ) ) + 
  geom_XXX()



```{r}
# Example 1: 
# This creates a histogram of the Height of the participants and colours it according to gender.

ggplot(NHANES, aes(x=Height, colour = Gender)) + 
  geom_histogram()
```

```{r}
# Example 2: 
# This creates a "density function" that mimics the shape of the previous histogram.

ggplot(NHANES, aes(x=Height, colour=Gender, fill=Gender)) + 
  geom_density(alpha=0.1) 
```


```{r}
# Example 3: 
# This creates a plot showing the relation between Height and Age, and colours it according to Gender. The points correspond to individuals.


ggplot(NHANES, aes(x=Age, y=Height, colour = Gender)) + 
  geom_point()
```

```{r}
# Example 4: 
# This creates a plot showing the relation between Height and Age, and colours it according to Gender. The lines describe the trend for each gender.


ggplot(NHANES, aes(x=Age, y=Height, colour = Gender)) + 
  geom_smooth()

```

```{r}
# Example 5:
# To filter a dataset we can go like this:

Women  = filter(NHANES, Gender == "female", Age >= 18)

```

# Exercise 1

1. Create a plot that shows the distribution of some numerical variable of adult Women in the form of a density function (you pick the variable!). 
2. Add a title and labels to your plot using the command labs(title = " ", x = " ", y = " ")
3. Change the theme.

```{r}


ggplot(Women, aes(x = Weight, color = Education, fill = Education)) + geom_density(alpha = 0.3) + labs(title = "Weight and Education Relationships of Women", x = "Weight", y = "Density") + theme_classic()


```


```{r }
# Example 6: 
# We are going to work with categorical data. 
# The function "tally" will allow us to count specific values in a data set. 
# When we use tilde symbol ~ that means that we are suboordinating certain calculation

tally(Education~Gender, NHANES, format = "proportion")

tally(Gender~Education, NHANES, format = "proportion")


```




----------------------------------------------------------

# Exercise 2

1. Use the 'tally' function to find the distribution (i.e. proportions) of Home Ownership Status BY Race, and that of Race BY Home Ownership Status.


```{r}

tally(HomeOwn~Race1, NHANES, format = "proportion")

tally(Race1~HomeOwn, NHANES, format = "proportion")

```

2. What proportion of White individuals are renting? [Write your answer using probability notation]

P(Rent | White) = 0.237602009

3. What proportion of renters are white? [Write your answer using probability notation]

P(White | Rent) = 0.46060237



```{r}
# Example 7:
# Barplots are useful to explote 'dependence' 

ggplot(NHANES, aes(x=Education, fill=Gender)) +
         geom_bar()

ggplot(NHANES, aes(x=Gender, fill=Education)) +
         geom_bar()

ggplot(NHANES, aes(x=Education, fill=Gender)) +
         geom_bar(position="fill") +
          guides(x = guide_axis(n.dodge = 2))

ggplot(NHANES, aes(x=HomeOwn, fill=Gender)) +
         geom_bar(position="fill") +
          guides(x = guide_axis(angle = 30))

ggplot(NHANES, aes(x=Education, fill=Gender)) +
         geom_bar(position="dodge")


```



# Exercise 3

Construct two bar plots showing the distribution of Home Ownership status by Race. Requirements: 

1. Labels, title, and subtitle (avoid overcrowding of labels).
2. Change the theme.


```{r}

ggplot(NHANES, aes(x = HomeOwn, fill = Race1)) + geom_bar(position = "fill") + labs(title = "Distribution of Home Ownership status by Race", subtitle = "Proportions of Home Ownership by Race Categories", x = "Home Ownership Status", y = "Proportion") + guides(x = guide_axis(angle = 45))

ggplot(NHANES, aes(x = HomeOwn, fill = Race1)) + geom_bar(position = "fill") + labs(title = "Distribution of Home Ownership status by Race", subtitle = "Proportions of Home Ownership by Race Categories", x = "Home Ownership Status", y = "Proportion") + guides(x = guide_axis(angle = 45)) + theme_dark()

```
